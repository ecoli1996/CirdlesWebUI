    "Ambapo, the Swahili word for 'where' was proposed as an open-source program that allows for a more user friendly way to bulk and solo convert locational data from latitude and longitude to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) and vice versa, as well as from latitude and longitude of one geodetic datum to that of another using Charles F.F. Karney's formulas."
